instructions:

1.	use 'G' as the goal when making a level
	the player's spawn is automatically the start

2.	the start is automatically represented by a pallet
	the goal is optional, but my levels also used pallets
	
3.	press 'space' to toggle players to move between their unique starts and the shared goal
	players are unaffected by 'space' when in motion
	pressing 'space' when one players are in motion and others aren't causes only motionless players to move
